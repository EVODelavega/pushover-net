pushover-net
============

Simple, standalone, clean PHP wrapper for the pushover.net API

## What is working:

Put simply, creating a message and sending it is working just fine (check examples/example.php for a working code example).
Is it working fully? Not quite, the receipt part of messages is not quite there yet. Still, seeing as most (if not all) API wrappers out there focus mainly (or even only) on the pushing of messages, I've put this wrapper out there already.
